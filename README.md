# My Cloud
[Demo](https://my-cloud-cad8a.web.app)
myCloud is a front-end project for web hosting companies. Using pure html and css, some javascript and font-awesome. The main inspiration I have for this project was how much i can handle the design with out using any external library.
## Requirements
You need `Node Js` to install font-awesome library. If you don't have you can find for your machine at nodejs.org. And `Git` to clone the repository.

## Get started

First clone the repository and navigate in to the directory. Then install font-awesome. By typing `npm i`, because the library is included in `package.json`.

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/abrahamaschalew/mycloud mycloud
cd mycloud
npm i
```

- You can open the project directly by opening index.html or you can use live server in your vsCode.
